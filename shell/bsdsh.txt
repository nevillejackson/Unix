the  C  shell"  (USD:4).   is a command programming language that
provides an interface to the operating system.  Its features  in-
clude  control-flow  primitives, parameter passing, variables and
string substitution.  Constructs such as  [4mwhile,[24m  [4mif[24m  [4mthen[24m  [4melse,[0m
[4mcase[24m  and  [4mfor[24m  are available.  Two-way communication is possible
between the [4mshell[24m and commands.  String-valued parameters,  typi-
cally  file names or flags, may be passed to a command.  A return
code is set by commands that may be used  to  determine  control-
flow, and the standard output from a command may be used as shell
input.  The [4mshell[24m can modify the environment  in  which  commands
run.   Input and output can be redirected to files, and processes
that communicate through `pipes' can be  invoked.   Commands  are
found  by  searching directories in the file system in a sequence
that can be defined by the user.  Commands  can  be  read  either
from the terminal or from a file, which allows command procedures
to be stored for later use.  1.0 Introduction The shell is both a
command  language and a programming language that provides an in-
terface to the UNIX operating system.  This memorandum describes,
with  examples, the UNIX shell.  The first section covers most of
the everyday requirements of terminal  users.   Some  familiarity
with UNIX is an advantage when reading this section; see, for ex-
ample, "UNIX for beginners".  unix beginn kernigh 1978 Section  2
describes  those features of the shell primarily intended for use
within shell procedures.  These include the  control-flow  primi-
tives  and  string-valued  variables  provided  by  the shell.  A
knowledge of a programming language would be a help when  reading
this  section.  The last section describes the more advanced fea-
tures of the shell.  References of the form "see [4mpipe[24m (2)" are to
a  section  of  the  UNIX  manual.  seventh 1978 ritchie thompson
1.1 Simple commands Simple commands consist of one or more  words
separated  by  blanks.  The first word is the name of the command
to be executed; any remaining words are passed  as  arguments  to
the  command.   For example,         who is a command that prints
the names of users logged in.  The command         ls -l prints a
list of files in the current directory.  The argument [4m-l[24m tells [4mls[0m
to print status information, size and the creation date for  each
file.   1.2 Background commands  To  execute  a command the shell
normally creates a new [4mprocess[24m and waits for  it  to  finish.   A
command  may  be run without waiting for it to finish.  For exam-
ple,         cc pgm.c & calls the C compiler to compile the  file
[4mpgm.c.[24m   The  trailing  [1m& [22mis an operator that instructs the shell
not to wait for the command to finish.  To  help  keep  track  of
such a process the shell reports its process number following its
creation.  A list of currently active processes may  be  obtained
using the [4mps[24m command.  1.3 Input output redirection Most commands
produce output on the standard output that is initially connected
to  the  terminal.  This output may be sent to a file by writing,
for example,         ls -l >file The notation [4m>file[24m is interpret-
ed  by the shell and is not passed as an argument to [4mls.[24m  If [4mfile[0m
does not exist then the shell creates it; otherwise the  original
contents  of  [4mfile[24m  are replaced with the output from [4mls.[24m  Output
may be appended to a file using the notation         ls  -l  file
In  this  case [4mfile[24m is also created if it does not already exist.
The standard input of a command may be taken from a file  instead
of  the  terminal  by  writing, for example,         wc <file The
command [4mwc[24m reads its standard input (in this case redirected from
[4mfile[24m) and prints the number of characters, words and lines found.
If only the number of lines is required then         wc -l  <file
could  be used.  1.4 Pipelines and filters The standard output of
one command may be connected to the standard input of another  by
writing  the `pipe' operator, indicated by , as in,         ls -l
wc Two commands connected in this way constitute a  [4mpipeline[24m  and
the  overall  effect is the same as         ls -l >file; wc <file
except that no [4mfile[24m is used.  Instead the two processes are  con-
nected  by  a pipe (see [4mpipe[24m (2)) and are run in parallel.  Pipes
are unidirectional and synchronization is achieved by halting  [4mwc[0m
when  there  is  nothing  to read and halting [4mls[24m when the pipe is
full.  A [4mfilter[24m is a  command  that  reads  its  standard  input,
transforms  it in some way, and prints the result as output.  One
such filter, [4mgrep,[24m selects from its input those lines  that  con-
tain  some  specified  string.  For example,         ls  grep old
prints those lines, if any, of the output from  [4mls[24m  that  contain
the  string  [4mold.[24m   Another  useful filter is [4msort[24m.  For example,
        who  sort will print an  alphabetically  sorted  list  of
logged  in  users.   A pipeline may consist of more than two com-
mands, for example,         ls  grep old  wc -l prints the number
of file names in the current directory containing the string [4mold.[0m
1.5 File name generation Many commands accept arguments which are
file names.  For example,         ls -l main.c prints information
relating to the file [4mmain.c[24m.  The shell provides a mechanism  for
generating  a list of file names that match a pattern.  For exam-
ple,         ls -l *.c generates, as arguments to  [4mls,[24m  all  file
names  in  the current directory that end in [4m.c.[24m  The character *
is a pattern that  will  match  any  string  including  the  null
string.   In  general [4mpatterns[24m are specified as follows.  Matches
any string of characters including the null string.  Matches  any
single character.  Matches any one of the characters enclosed.  A
pair of characters separated by a minus will match any  character
lexically  between the pair.  For example,         [a-z]* matches
all names in the current directory beginning with one of the let-
ters [4ma[24m through [4mz.[24m          /usr/fred/test/?  matches all names in
the directory [1m/usr/fred/test [22mthat consist of a single  character.
If  no  file name is found that matches the pattern then the pat-
tern is passed, unchanged, as an  argument.   This  mechanism  is
useful  both to save typing and to select names according to some
pattern.  It may also  be  used  to  find  files.   For  example,
        echo  /usr/fred/*/core  finds and prints the names of all
[4mcore[24m files in sub-directories of [1m/usr/fred.  [22m([4mecho[24m is a  standard
UNIX  command  that  prints  its arguments, separated by blanks.)
This last feature can be expensive, requiring a scan of all  sub-
directories  of [1m/usr/fred.  [22mThere is one exception to the general
rules given for patterns.  The character `[1m.[22m'  at the start  of  a
file name must be explicitly matched.          echo * will there-
fore echo all file names in the current directory  not  beginning
with  `[1m.[22m'.           echo  [1m.[22m* will echo all those file names that
begin with `[1m.[22m'.  This avoids inadvertent matching  of  the  names
`[1m.[22m'  and `[1m..[22m'  which mean `the current directory' and `the parent
directory' respectively.  (Notice that [4mls[24m suppresses  information
for  the files `[1m.[22m' and `[1m..[22m'.)  1.6 Quoting Characters that have a
special meaning to the shell, such as [1m< >  *  ?   &,  [22mare  called
metacharacters.   A  complete  list of metacharacters is given in
appendix B.  Any character preceded by a [1m\ [22mis  [4mquoted[24m  and  loses
its   special   meaning,  if  any.   The  [1m\  [22mis  elided  so  that
        echo \\?  will echo a single  [1m?,  [22mand          echo  \\\\
will echo a single [1m\.  [22mTo allow long strings to be continued over
more than one line the sequence [1m\newline [22mis ignored.  [1m\ [22mis conve-
nient  for quoting single characters.  When more than one charac-
ter needs quoting the above mechanism is clumsy and error  prone.
A  string of characters may be quoted by enclosing the string be-
tween single quotes.  For example,         echo  xx'****'xx  will
echo          xx****xx The quoted string may not contain a single
quote but may contain newlines, which are preserved.  This  quot-
ing  mechanism  is  the most simple and is recommended for casual
use.  A third quoting  mechanism  using  double  quotes  is  also
available  that  prevents  interpretation  of  some  but  not all
metacharacters.  Discussion of the details is deferred to section
3.4.   1.7 Prompting  When  the  shell is used from a terminal it
will issue a prompt before reading a command.   By  default  this
prompt  is  `[1m$ [22m'.   It  may  be  changed  by saying, for example,
        PS1=yesdear that sets the prompt to be  the  string  [4myes-[0m
[4mdear.[24m  If a newline is typed and further input is needed then the
shell will issue the prompt `[1m> [22m'.  Sometimes this can  be  caused
by mistyping a quote mark.  If it is unexpected then an interrupt
(DEL) will return the shell to read another command.  This prompt
may   be   changed   by  saying,  for  example,          PS2=more
1.8 The shell and login Following [4mlogin[24m (1) the shell  is  called
to  read  and execute commands typed at the terminal.  If the us-
er's login directory contains the file [1m.profile [22mthen  it  is  as-
sumed to contain commands and is read by the shell before reading
any commands from the terminal.  1.9 Summary
