### Summary of s6-66 exploration ###
#### Introduction ####
There was a long topic 
https://itsfoss.community/t/s6-init-system-with-s6-66-service-manager-in-antix-init-diversity-spin/11984
in which I took a first look at the `66` Service Manager for the S6 init system. 

I was fortunate to obtain assistance from
 - @ProwlerGR -- the author of the init diversity spins
 - @Obarun -- the author of the `66` service manager and also creator of the Obarun distro which is Arch Linux with S6-66. 

It is time for a summary.
This is a stage summary, not a tutorial.

We are fortunate to have been able to see this important development in its early stages, and we appreciate the assistance of @ProwlerGR and @Obarun.  

Please make any corrections or modifications. I have learnt something, but I am by no means an expert.
