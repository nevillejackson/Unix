### Three axes of the Christmas Story ###
The allegorical or symbolic significance of the characters and events of the Christmas Story can be seen as three axes of immense importance both today and in the culture of the time. They are:

 1. *Status*:  Common poor people ( represented by the Shepherds) and educated well-off people ( represented by the Three Wise Men and the Gifts)

 2. *World View*: The natural world ( represented by the animals) and the supernatural or spiritual realm ( represented by the Star of Bethlehem)

 3. *Ethics*:  Good  ( represented by Jesus, Mary, and Joseph) and Evil (represented by Herod and the Slaughter of the Innocents)

It was a powerful story. In combination with the Easter Story, it spread like a virus in the Ancient World.  It displaced the pagan beliefs of the Roman Empire. Over time it has become part of many cultures and traditions, quite apart from its special significance to Christians

We celebrate Christmas today , because the three themes or axes of the Christmas Story  still have meaning today. Those three dimensions are still the major axes of our modern culture.
We still have an educational divide and a poverty gap. We still have environmental concerns and a fear of the unknown. We still have a Problem of Evil and its consequences such as today's refugee problem, which is reflected in the Christmas Story by the Flight into Egypt.

The gifts from the Magi have today become an integral part of our Christmas cellebrations

Whatever your background or beliefs, enjoy your Christmas celebrations, everyone. It is meant to be a happy time.... a time of peace, joy, and serious reflection.
