### Some special features of antiX25 ###

AntiX is an unusual distro. Even with just a glimpse at the live iso, you will see some things that are not found elsewhere. 

Here is a brief look at the features that impress me

#### Icons on the taskbar ####

#### Discussion ####

There are, of course other features. AntiX is tailored for older systems with fewer resources. It has 32 bit .iso's. It has a small footprint. Hence, the Window Manager rather than a full DE. You can install any of the major DE's if you wish. 

The antX25beta1 version I am currently testing is a 'full' iso. On the main download site

https://antixlinux.com/download/

there are 'full', 'base', 'core', and 'net' downloads available, in 64 and 32 bit.  It does not support other architectures ( eg arm).
