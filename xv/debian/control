 The XV "jumbo" patches are a pair of aggregate patches against XV 3.10a, which
 was last released in December 1994. The first jumbo patch incorporates roughly
 two dozen bugfixes. The second patch encompasses almost as many enhancements,
 including support for additional image formats like PNG, PhotoCD, and PDF;
 performance improvements; and new features such as mouse-wheel support, alpha
 blending against a background color, and improved dithering for 15/16-bit
 displays. All patches available from the official XV site are included, as
 well as numerous other patches from around the world.
