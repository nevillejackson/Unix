 Permission to copy and distribute XV in its entirety, for non-commercial
 purposes, is hereby granted without fee, provided that this license
 information and copyright notice appear unmodified in all copies.
 .
 Note that distributing XV 'bundled' in with any product is considered
 to be a 'commercial purpose'.
 .
 Also note that any copies of XV that are distributed must be built
 and/or configured to be in their 'unregistered copy' mode, so that it
 is made obvious to the user that XV is shareware, and that they should
 consider donating, or at least reading this License Info.
 .
 The software may be modified for your own purposes, but modified
 versions may not be distributed without prior consent of the author.
 .
 This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
 warranty.  In no event will the author be held liable for any damages
 arising from the use of this software.
 .
 If you would like to do something with XV that this copyright
 prohibits (such as distributing it with a commercial product,
 using portions of the source in some other program, etc.), please
 contact the author (preferably via email).  Arrangements can
 probably be worked out.
 .
 XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only.  You may use XV for your own
 amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of
 some value to you, your non-deductable donation would be greatly
 appreciated.  $25 is the suggested donation, though, of course,
 larger donations are quite welcome.  Folks who donate $25 or more
 can receive a Real Nice bound copy of the XV manual for no extra
 charge.
 .
 Commercial, government, and institutional users must register their
 copies of XV, for the price of $25 per workstation/X terminal or per
 XV user, whichever is less.  Note that it does NOT say 'simultaneous user',
 but rather, the total number of people who use XV on any sort of
 recurring basis. Site licenses are available (and recommended) for those
 who wish to run XV on a large (>10) number of machines.
 Contact the author for more details.

 Greetings. Mr. Bradley has moved to South America and become a warrior-god
 to some hitherto-unknown Amazon river tribe. However, he advises that he
 grants you permission to distribute the modified version of XV as long as
 all license agreements and other terms are distributed with the code as per
 the terms of the license.
 .
 Actually, he just doesn't like talking to people -- that's what he has me
 for!
 .
 Best regards --
 --Daniel

 All license agreements and other terms can be found in `/usr/share/doc/xv/README.gz'.

 * The outline of this is shamelessly derived from xvpbm.c to read the
 * file, and xvtiffwr.c to handle the popup window and X stuff (X never
 * has been my forte !), and the PhotoCD format information (though not
 * the code) was found in Hadmut Danisch's (danisch@ira.uka.de) hpcdtoppm
 * program in which he has reverse engineered the format by studying
 * hex dumps of PhotoCDs ! After all who can afford the Kodak developer's
 * kit, which none of us have seen yet ? Am I even allowed to mention these
 * words (Kodak, PhotoCD) ? I presume they are registered trade marks.

 1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
    please let us know!)
 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.

 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 .
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.

 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's

 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of

 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.  It
 is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 .
 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
 patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
 legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
 support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
 Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
 So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
 code.
