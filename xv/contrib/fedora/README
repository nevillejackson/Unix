Greg,
     After winding up in dark lonely places trying to
get xv-3.10a to build on FC5 I suspected I was missing
something.  Then I happened on your patch manifest
in Slackware 10.2.

I bandsawed the script a bit to use in propagating XV
to a handful of personal FC5 machines.  Attached for
reference.

Thanks for your effort!
