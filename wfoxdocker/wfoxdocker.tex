\title{Making a docker image to run the Waterfox browser}

\section{Introduction} 
This project is about learning how to compose a Dockerfile which runs an X11 application. The Waterfox browser was chosen as an example X11 application, because Waterfox is not available as a package in most Linux distributions, so the result might actually be a useful means of obtaining Waterfox without having to download a tarfile and do a local install. 

Getting a running Docker container to talk to the X11 server in the host system is relatively easy. Waterfox is a large and complex X application, and most of the challenge of this project is in setting up in the Docker image a working environmejnt for Waterfox. 

\section{What is involved in a normal Waterfox install?}
There is a document~\cite{wate:22a} on that.  Briefly the steps are
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download a tarfile from the Waterfox website~\cite{wate:22} or from the Github site~\cite{wate:22b}.
\item  Unpack the tarfile in /usr/local/src
\begin{verbatim}
bzip2 -dc waterfox-G4.1.1.1.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
\end{verbatim}
\item Make a link in /usr/local/bin to point to the Waterfox binary
\begin{verbatim}
ln /usr/local/src/waterfox/waterfox /usr/local/bin/waterfox
\end{verbatim}
\item Define the desktop icon by adding a file waterfox.desktop to the directory /usr/share applications. The file waterfox.desktop does not come with the tarfile, but is available here~\cite{wate:22a}
\end{enumerate}
We need to implement steps 1 to 3 in a Dockerfile. Step 4 can be omitted, as there will be no icon if running Waterfox in a container. The container will have to be started from the command line.


\section{First attempt at a Dockerfile, using  Debian parent image}
I chose Debian parent image for a first attempt, because Debian is familiar and is most likely to compatable with Waterfox.
